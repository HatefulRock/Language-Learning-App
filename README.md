# LingoLeap üöÄ

**Read, learn, and speak your target language with an AI-powered companion that adapts to you.**

LingoLeap is a next-generation language learning application built for serious, independent learners. It moves beyond simple flashcards and gamified lessons to create a deeply immersive and effective learning environment. By integrating with your own content and leveraging powerful local AI, LingoLeap helps you turn reading into fluency.

## About The Project

Traditional language apps often keep you in a walled garden, learning disconnected vocabulary. LingoLeap is different. It's built on the principle that the most effective way to learn is by engaging with content you find interesting, and the best way to remember is through context and intelligent repetition.

This application is for the learner who wants to:
*   **Read anything:** From news articles and blog posts to entire novels.
*   **Understand deeply:** Get instant, multi-layered translations and grammatical explanations.
*   **Remember forever:** Turn new words into mastered vocabulary with a sophisticated Spaced Repetition System (SRS).
*   **Practice speaking:** Build conversational confidence in a safe, low-pressure environment with an AI partner.

LingoLeap is built with a high-performance Rust backend and a modern React frontend using the Tauri framework, ensuring it is fast, secure, and can run powerful AI features locally on your machine‚Äîwith or without an internet connection.

## ‚ú® Core Features

LingoLeap is designed around five core pillars to create a complete learning ecosystem.

### üìö Pillar 1: The Immersive Reader
The gateway to learning. Import content from the web, `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.epub` files, or use our curated library. Hover over or tap any word for instant assistance.
*   **User-Driven Content:** You choose what you want to read.
*   **Contextual Assistance:** Get translations, definitions, and more without leaving your text.
*   **Curated Library:** Access pre-sorted texts from A1 to C2 difficulty.

### üß† Pillar 2: The Vocabulary Engine
An intelligent core that converts struggling words into mastered vocabulary. Every word you look up is automatically added to a dynamic learning system.
*   **Progressive Familiarity Score:** A nuanced 1-5 score tracks how well you know a word.
*   **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** An Anki-like algorithm, powered by your Familiarity Score, tells you the optimal time to review.
*   **Contextual Flashcards:** Never forget where you saw a word. Each flashcard includes the original sentence, dramatically improving recall.

### ü§ñ Pillar 3: AI-Powered Practice
Go beyond rote memorization. Our integrated AI provides deep linguistic insights and creates exercises tailored just for you.
*   **Smart Sentence Analysis:** Highlight any sentence to get an idiomatic translation, a literal translation, and a complete grammatical breakdown.
*   **Local LLM Support:** All AI features can run 100% offline on your machine for ultimate privacy and performance.
*   **Dynamic Exercise Generator:** Creates personalized quizzes using the words you're struggling with the most.

### üó£Ô∏è Pillar 4: Conversational Fluency Module
A safe environment to practice active speaking and listening skills. Engage in role-playing scenarios with an AI tutor who is always available.
*   **High-Quality Audio:** Hear natural-sounding speech for any word or sentence.
*   **AI Conversation Partner:** Practice real-world scenarios, from ordering coffee to discussing ideas.
*   **Pronunciation Feedback:** Get targeted feedback on your speech to help you sound more like a native speaker.

### üèÜ Pillar 5: Motivation & Engagement
A framework to keep you consistent and focused on your journey.
*   **Gamification Engine:** Maintain streaks, earn points, and unlock achievements for your hard work.
*   **Personalized Goal Setting:** Define what you want to achieve, and let the app help you track your progress.
*   **Proactive Reminders:** Get gentle nudges to help you stay on track with your self-defined goals.
